# SecurityPlus
Security++ provides enhanced security to desktop machines.
Implemented a lock screen for systems to provide security to the machine owner. However, if someone enters a wrong password, then the owner is immediately notified with the image of the malicious person via email. The users are not allowed to hide their faces while entering the password for security purposes.
